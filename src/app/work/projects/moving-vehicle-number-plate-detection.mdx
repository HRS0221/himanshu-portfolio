## Project Overview

This project was developed for Smart India Hackathon 2022 (Software Edition) and focuses on detecting and recognizing vehicle registration plates from moving vehicles in real-time. The system uses advanced computer vision techniques and deep learning to identify number plates and extract text for further processing.

## What I Built

### Core System Architecture
- **Object Detection**: YOLOv7 model for license plate detection
- **Text Recognition**: Dual OCR approach using EasyOCR and Plate Recognizer API
- **Web Interface**: Flask-based web application for easy interaction
- **Video Processing**: Real-time processing capabilities for moving vehicles

### Key Features
- **Real-time Detection**: Processes images and videos in real-time
- **Multi-format Support**: Handles both image uploads and video streams
- **Dual OCR Strategy**: Combines local EasyOCR with cloud-based Plate Recognizer API
- **Pattern Validation**: Validates number plate formats using regex patterns
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly Flask web application

## Technical Implementation

### Deep Learning Pipeline
1. **YOLOv7 Model**: Pre-trained model converted to ONNX format for efficient inference
2. **Image Preprocessing**: Letterboxing and normalization for model input
3. **Object Detection**: Bounding box detection with confidence scores
4. **ROI Extraction**: Region of Interest extraction for text recognition

### OCR Implementation
```python
# Dual OCR Strategy
def extract_text(ROI):
    # Local OCR using EasyOCR
    results = reader.readtext(ROI, detail=0)
    # Pattern validation and text cleaning
    return processed_text

def Plate_Recognizer(img_path):
    # Cloud-based OCR using Plate Recognizer API
    response = requests.post(
        'https://api.platerecognizer.com/v1/plate-reader/',
        files=dict(upload=fp),
        headers={'Authorization': 'Token YOUR_TOKEN'}
    )
    return response.json()
```

### Web Application
- **Flask Backend**: RESTful API for image processing
- **File Upload**: Support for image and video files
- **Real-time Processing**: Immediate feedback on detection results
- **Result Display**: Visual output with bounding boxes and extracted text

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Real-time Performance

## Code Snippets

### YOLO Detection Function
```python
def get_detections(img):
    # Image preprocessing
    image, ratio, dwdh = letterbox(image, auto=False)
    image = image.transpose((2, 0, 1))
    image = np.expand_dims(image, 0)
    
    # Model inference
    outputs = session.run(outname, inp)[0]
    
    # Post-processing
    for i,(batch_id,x0,y0,x1,y1,cls_id,score) in enumerate(outputs):
        box = np.array([x0,y0,x1,y1])
        box -= np.array(dwdh*2)
        box /= ratio
        box = box.round().astype(np.int32).tolist()
        roi.append(box.copy())
    
    return ori_images[0], outputs, roi
```

### Flask Web Application
```python
@app.route('/',methods=['POST','GET'])
def index():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        upload_file = request.files['image_name']
        filename = upload_file.filename
        path_save = os.path.join(UPLOAD_PATH, filename)
        upload_file.save(path_save)
        
        # Process image
        text_list, Detected, D_status, Recognized, R_status = object_detection(path_save, filename)
        
        return render_template('index.html', 
                             upload=True, 
                             upload_image=filename, 
                             text=text_list)
    
    return render_template('index.html', upload=False)
```

### Pattern Validation
```python
def validate_number_plate(text):
    # Indian number plate patterns
    patterns = [
        r'^\w{2}\d{2}\w{2}\d{4}$',  # MH12AB1234
        r'^\w{2}\d{2}\w{3}$',       # MH12ABC
        r'\w{2}\d{2}\w{1}\d{4}$'    # MH12A1234
    ]
    
    for pattern in patterns:
        if re.match(pattern, text):
            return True
    return False
```
