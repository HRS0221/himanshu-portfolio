## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data engineering workflow for analyzing YouTube trending videos across 10 different countries. The goal was to build a scalable, cloud-based pipeline that could process large volumes of video data and provide actionable insights through interactive dashboards.

## What I Built

### Data Pipeline Architecture
- **Data Ingestion**: Collected YouTube trending video data from 10 regions (US, UK, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia, France, Germany, Canada)
- **Storage**: Implemented AWS S3 with Hive-style partitioning by region for efficient querying
- **Processing**: Used AWS Glue for ETL transformations and data cataloging
- **Querying**: Leveraged Amazon Athena for serverless SQL queries
- **Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards using Amazon QuickSight

### Key Features
- **Multi-region Analysis**: Processed data from 10 different countries
- **Scalable Architecture**: Cloud-native design handling 400MB+ of data
- **Cost Optimization**: Implemented data partitioning to reduce query costs
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Real-time insights into video performance patterns

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
The project processed two types of data:
- **Video Statistics**: CSV files containing trending video data (title, views, likes, comments, etc.)
- **Category Metadata**: JSON files mapping category IDs to category names

### AWS Services Used
1. **S3 Bucket**: `himanshu-de-on-youtube-raw-useast1-dev`
   - Raw data storage with region-based partitioning
   - Separate folders for statistics and reference data

2. **AWS Glue**: 
   - Data cataloging and ETL transformations
   - Schema discovery and data type inference

3. **Amazon Athena**:
   - Serverless SQL queries on S3 data
   - Cost-effective analysis without managing infrastructure

4. **Amazon QuickSight**:
   - Interactive dashboards and visualizations
   - Real-time data exploration

### Data Partitioning Strategy
Implemented Hive-style partitioning by region:
```
s3://bucket/youtube/raw_statistics/region=us/
s3://bucket/youtube/raw_statistics/region=in/
s3://bucket/youtube/raw_statistics/region=jp/
```

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Large Data Volume
**Problem**: Processing 400MB+ of data across multiple regions
**Solution**: Implemented cloud-native architecture with AWS services for scalability

### Challenge 2: Data Organization
**Problem**: Managing data from 10 different regions efficiently
**Solution**: Used Hive-style partitioning to organize data by region, enabling efficient querying

### Challenge 3: Cost Optimization
**Problem**: Minimizing AWS service costs while maintaining performance
**Solution**: Leveraged serverless services (Athena, Lambda) and implemented data partitioning

## Results & Insights

### Dashboard Deliverables
Created three comprehensive dashboards:
1. **Regional Performance Analysis**: Video trends across different countries
2. **Engagement Metrics**: Views, likes, comments, and dislikes patterns
3. **Category Analysis**: Performance by video categories

### Key Findings
- Identified regional differences in video preferences
- Discovered optimal posting times for maximum engagement
- Analyzed correlation between video length and viewer retention
- Mapped trending topics across different cultures

## What I Learned

### Technical Skills
- **AWS Cloud Services**: Hands-on experience with S3, Glue, Lambda, Athena, QuickSight
- **Data Partitioning**: Understanding of Hive-style partitioning for efficient data access
- **ETL Pipeline Design**: End-to-end data engineering workflow
- **Cost Optimization**: Strategies for minimizing cloud service costs

### Data Engineering Best Practices
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designing systems that can handle growing data volumes
- **Data Organization**: Importance of proper data structuring for efficient querying
- **Cloud-Native Solutions**: Leveraging serverless services for cost-effectiveness
- **Data Visualization**: Creating meaningful insights from raw data

## Code Snippets

### AWS CLI Commands for Data Upload
```bash
# Copy reference data to S3
aws s3 cp . s3://himanshu-de-on-youtube-raw-useast1-dev/youtube/raw_statistics_reference_data/ --recursive --exclude "*" --include "*.json"

# Copy regional data with partitioning
aws s3 cp USvideos.csv s3://himanshu-de-on-youtube-raw-useast1-dev/youtube/raw_statistics/region=us/
aws s3 cp INvideos.csv s3://himanshu-de-on-youtube-raw-useast1-dev/youtube/raw_statistics/region=in/
```

### Sample Athena Query
```sql
SELECT 
    region,
    category_name,
    COUNT(*) as video_count,
    AVG(views) as avg_views
FROM youtube_data
WHERE publish_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY region, category_name
ORDER BY avg_views DESC
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Real-time Processing**: Implement streaming data pipeline using Kinesis
2. **Machine Learning**: Add predictive analytics for video performance
3. **API Integration**: Connect to YouTube API for live data updates
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Implement sentiment analysis on video comments

## Project Impact

This project showcases my ability to:
- Design and implement end-to-end data engineering solutions
- Work with large-scale data processing in the cloud
- Create meaningful visualizations and insights
- Optimize costs while maintaining performance
- Handle multi-region data analysis

The skills gained from this project directly apply to real-world data engineering challenges and demonstrate my proficiency with modern cloud technologies.
