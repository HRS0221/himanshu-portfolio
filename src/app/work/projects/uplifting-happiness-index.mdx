## Project Overview

The Uplifting Happiness Index is a comprehensive mood recognition system that combines facial expression analysis and speech emotion detection to provide accurate mood assessment. The system uses advanced machine learning techniques to analyze both visual and auditory cues for emotion classification.

## What I Built

- **Integration**: Combined analysis with facial recognition

### System Architecture
```python
# Main application structure
def main():
    # Initialize both recognition systems
    facial_system = FacialMoodRecognition()
    speech_system = SpeechMoodRecognition()
    
    # Combined analysis
    def analyze_mood():
        facial_result = facial_system.detect_emotion()
        speech_result = speech_system.analyze_speech()
        
        # Combine results for final assessment
        final_mood = combine_results(facial_result, speech_result)
        return final_mood
```

    def __init__(self):
        self.face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
        self.emotion_model = load_emotion_model()
    
    def detect_emotion(self, frame):
        # Face detection
        faces = self.face_cascade.detectMultiScale(frame, 1.1, 4)
        
        for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
            face_roi = frame[y:y+h, x:x+w]
            
            # Preprocess face for emotion detection
            processed_face = self.preprocess_face(face_roi)
            
            # Predict emotion
            emotion = self.emotion_model.predict(processed_face)
            
            return emotion
    
    def preprocess_face(self, face_img):
        # Resize and normalize
        face_img = cv2.resize(face_img, (48, 48))
        face_img = face_img / 255.0
        return np.expand_dims(face_img, axis=0)
```

### Speech Recognition Implementation
```python
class SpeechMoodRecognition:
    def __init__(self):
        self.audio_model = load_audio_model()
        self.feature_extractor = AudioFeatureExtractor()
    
    def analyze_speech(self, audio_data):
        # Extract audio features
        features = self.feature_extractor.extract_features(audio_data)
        
        # Predict emotion from speech

### Combined Analysis
```python
def combine_results(facial_result, speech_result):

    facial_confidence = facial_result['confidence']
    speech_confidence = speech_result['confidence']
    
    # Calculate weighted emotion scores
    combined_emotion = {}
    for emotion in emotions:
        facial_score = facial_result['scores'][emotion] * facial_confidence
        speech_score = speech_result['scores'][emotion] * speech_confidence
        
        combined_emotion[emotion] = (facial_score + speech_score) / 2
    
    # Return emotion with highest score
    final_emotion = max(combined_emotion, key=combined_emotion.get)
    
    return {
        'emotion': final_emotion,
        'confidence': combined_emotion[final_emotion],
